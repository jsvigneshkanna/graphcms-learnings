# Frontend

- Till now we have created content data and stored them in CMS database. We need a front facing application, so that users can access and add/ modify content data.For frontend client, we will be using React JS framework. Throughout this learnings, we will be using NPM to install packages (if yarn to be used, use `yarn` instead of `npm install`)

- For styling we will be using bootstrap

## Frontend Steps

1. First create a NextJS react app and name it `npx next-react-app graphcms_gtacars_blog`
2. Installing Bootstrap `npm install --verbose bootstrap`
3. Installing react router to routes different components as pages `npm install --verbose react-router-dom`
